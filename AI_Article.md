## **Projects: Paper Interpreter and AI Code Review**

### **1. Paper Interpreter**
**Overview**:  
Paper Interpreter is an AI-powered academic assistant I developed during this course. It parses academic PDFs, generates summaries, extracts insights, and creates presentation slides.  

#### **Workflow**:
1. **Upload Academic Paper**: Users upload PDFs.
2. **Select Outputs**: Users choose summaries, visual aids, or research gaps.
3. **Generate Outputs**: AI provides customized results.

#### **Impact**:  
This tool saves time and enhances accessibility for researchers, students, and educators by automating tedious academic tasks.

### **2. AI Code Review**
**Overview**:  
AI Code Review is a static analysis tool that integrates GitHub pull requests, Pylint, and AI models (like CodeBERT) to automate code reviews. It provides actionable feedback on code quality, inefficiencies, and potential issues.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **GitHub Integration**: Fetches pull requests and analyzes code changes.
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses CodeBERT for advanced code quality scoring.
3. **Pylint Scoring**: Evaluates Python code for syntax errors and inefficiencies.
4. **Web Interface**: Displays results via a Flask-based dashboard.
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automates analysis via GitHub Actions, updating pull request status.
6. **Email Notifications**: Sends analysis results to contributors.

#### **How It Works**:
- Contributors push code changes to GitHub.
- The tool analyzes pull requests using AI and static code analysis.
- It assigns a quality score; PRs with scores below 6/10 cannot be merged until resolved.
- Results are displayed on a web interface and emailed to contributors.

#### **Learning Outcomes**:
This project taught me:
- How to fine-tune AI models like CodeBERT.
- The importance of automating workflows in software development.
- The potential of integrating AI with CI/CD pipelines for continuous improvement.
